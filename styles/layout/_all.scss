// Layouts / Partials
// =======
//
// Layouts classes are common design patterns, not unique to the site specifically.
// These classes are not designed to be tinkered with, since they affect high-level
// layout properties and carry little visual styling.
//
// Rather than trying to create new pages with unique layouts, you may find all the
// layout patterns you'll need right here.
